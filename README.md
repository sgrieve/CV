# CV

Repo containing the tex file for my current CV, built around the template made by [Simon Mudd](github.com/simon-m-mudd/CV_SMudd/). Requires Xelatex and the fonts [heuristica](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/).

Build using `sh build.sh` with the argument `short` for a short CV and with no arguments for the full CV.
